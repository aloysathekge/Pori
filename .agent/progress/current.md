# Current State - 2026-07-21

## Active Task

R9 primary-job simulation is active on
`aloy-v1-r9-primary-job-simulation`, branched from `aloy-v1` after PR #199.
Exact-build receipts, responsive/resource-state evidence, focus, contrast,
lean retained artifacts, stage timings, dense-content/approval fixtures, and
the credit-free primary-job browser gate are complete on the working branch.

## Decisions Made

- `aloy-v1` remains the integration branch; R9 is not a path directly to
  `main`.
- Quality evidence belongs to the trusted host and exact retained build. The
  Builder, generated application, and any optional Critic never receive
  publication power.
- Quality policy `@5` covers validation, runtime, declared interactions, five
  responsive viewports, seven resource lifecycles plus dense-content and
  approval scenarios at desktop/mobile sizes, keyboard focus, text contrast,
  capture integrity, basic DOM accessibility, and primary-job evidence.
- A Surface request freezes its requested jobs before Builder execution as a
  fingerprinted receipt. Candidate metadata and `surface.json` must preserve
  those exact ids, descriptions, and order; mismatch fails before persistence.
- Primary jobs use bounded accessible click/fill/select steps. Assertions can
  prove exact named UI, exactly one schema-valid SDK request, committed
  capability-scoped Surface state, or host-owned approval state. The host
  browser resets Event context and binds each result and timing to the build.
- A visual Critic is deferred and optional. It is not a V1 publication gate;
  deterministic inspection plus Builder rules carry the required quality path.
- All 23 required compositions are deterministically inspected. Only five
  baseline viewports retain PNGs; 18 state/scenario compositions retain signed
  observations and fingerprints, avoiding unnecessary image/model latency.
- Focus Visible is blocking at the WCAG 2.2 AA level. Stronger 2px/3:1 focus
  appearance is recorded as evidence without claiming the optional AAA level.
- Text contrast blocks below 4.5:1 for normal text or 3:1 for large text. Text
  over an unresolvable image/gradient backdrop fails closed instead of guessing.
- Resource state is real product context, not a publication-test flag. Generated
  code consumes it through `useSurfaceResourceState` and binds its visible
  primary region using SDK-owned feedback props.
- Long content populates ordinary capability-scoped Event shapes. Approval uses
  pending Proposal and `waiting_approval` Interaction truth;
  `useSurfaceApprovalState` binds a summary while controls remain host-owned.
- A stricter new-publication gate must not remove rollback to a previously
  published legacy last-good build.

## Important Discoveries

- The current primary-job slice passes `44` focused backend tests across
  requests, pipeline, exact-build quality, and real browser build inspection;
  Ruff passes on all changed Python files.
- The scenario slice passes 47 focused backend tests, the SDK TypeScript build,
  Ruff, and mypy across 126 backend files. Browser proofs accept the SDK-bound
  approval summary and reject both missing approval binding and dense overflow.
- The full backend suite exceeded a bounded six-minute command deadline without
  reporting a failure; it is not recorded as passing or failing.

## Blockers

- Remote evidence transport and the reviewed widget registry remain R9 work.
- Live University, Madrid, and Career provider proofs and pinned remote E2B
  acceptance remain deferred gates.

## Next Session Should Start With

Run the wider backend/type checks, then commit the primary-job slice. Continue
R9 with remote evidence transport or the reviewed SDK/widget foundation.
