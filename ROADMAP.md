# Pori Roadmap

This document outlines the planned features, improvements, and areas where we're seeking community contributions.

## Vision

Pori aims to be the simplest, most extensible AI agent framework for Python developers. Our focus is on **clarity, modularity, and ease of use** rather than trying to be feature-complete.

## Current Version: 0.1.0

### âœ… Implemented Features

- Core agent with planning and reflection
- Memory system with conversation history and tool tracking
- Tool registry with Pydantic validation
- Task orchestration with parallel execution support
- Built-in tools (core, math, numbers, filesystem,)
- LangChain integration for LLM providers
- Comprehensive logging
- FastAPI server for async task execution


### Human-in-the-Loop

  - *Help wanted: Workflow design, UX*

- [ ] **Intervention System**
  - Pause execution for human input
  - Modify agent plans mid-execution
  - Override tool calls
  - *Help wanted: Interactive systems design*

### Advanced Features

- [ ] **Multi-Agent Coordination**
  - Agent-to-agent communication
  - Hierarchical task delegation
  - Shared knowledge bases
  - *Help wanted: Distributed systems, multi-agent architectures*

- [ ] **Learning from Feedback**
  - Capture human corrections
  - Fine-tune prompts based on feedback
  - Preference learning
  - *Help wanted: ML/RL experience*

### Advanced Capabilities

- [ ] **Multimodal Support**
  - Image understanding
  - Document processing
  - Audio/video handling
  - *Help wanted: Multimodal AI experience*

- [ ] **Code Generation & Execution**
  - Safe code execution sandboxes
  - Jupyter kernel integration
  - Code analysis tools
  - *Help wanted: Sandboxing, security*

### Observability

- [ ] **Monitoring & Metrics**
  - Prometheus/Grafana integration
  - Custom metrics and dashboards
  - Alert systems
  - *Help wanted: Observability, SRE*

## How to Contribute

See [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) for detailed instructions on how to contribute to any of these areas.

### Proposing New Features

Before working on a major feature:

1. Check this roadmap and existing issues
2. Open a GitHub Discussion to gather feedback
3. Create a detailed feature proposal issue
4. Get maintainer approval before significant work
5. Break down into smaller, reviewable PRs

### Feature Requests

Have an idea not on this roadmap? We'd love to hear it!

- Open a [Feature Request](https://github.com/your-username/pori/issues/new?template=feature_request.md)
- Participate in [Discussions](https://github.com/your-username/pori/discussions)
- Join community conversations



To maintain focus, we explicitly don't plan to:

- Build a no-code/low-code interface (there are other projects for that)
- Support every possible LLM provider natively (LangChain handles this)
- Become a full workflow orchestration system (e.g., Airflow replacement)
- Implement agent UI frameworks (focus is on backend)

## Versioning Policy

- **Major versions** (1.0, 2.0): Breaking API changes
- **Minor versions** (0.1, 0.2): New features, backward compatible
- **Patch versions** (0.1.1, 0.1.2): Bug fixes only

## Questions?
